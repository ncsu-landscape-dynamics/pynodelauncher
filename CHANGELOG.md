# Change Log

All notable changes to this project should be documented in this file.

The _Unreleased_ section should become the release once the release is ready
and the text can be used as part of the release description.
The pre-release historical sections are using dates and topics as section
headings instead of release numbers.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
However, the version number is under 1.0.0, so breaking changes are expected
at any point.
